# Time Series Forecasting

This project focuses on time series forecasting. It includes data, notebooks for analysis and modeling, and a virtual environment with the necessary dependencies.

## Data

The `data` directory contains the following datasets:

* `Data.csv`: Main dataset.
* `wind_dataset.csv`: Wind dataset.
* `wind_dataset_out.csv`: Processed wind dataset.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Model development (e.g., EDLM, RTTM with PyTorch and GRU)

## Getting Started
